[on hold] 1. move all resoruces to part of executable (may be via makefile). like in ship.c. 
3. create dialogs [no allegro helpers]
5. random planets generation?


General ideas:

Gravity:
1. Create a gravity based game so that you have different, weird, objects with different gravity and spaceship is attracted to these planets. If you don't play right you can crash. 
2. Consider planting prices to collect close to planets so that the player has to collect but not to crash. Prices give money. 
3. You also have store where you can upgrade your ship with money you collected. 
4. With better ship you can come to more complex / dangerous places. 

Places:

Neutrino stars
Black holes
Rotating black holes
White dwarfs
Stars
x-ray pulsars
Comets
Supernovae
Clusters
Galaxies
